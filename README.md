## Description

_Gamehub_ is an online store where users can purchase computer games. This gaming market platform lets you buy video games online for any device.
It is an online website store with a massive range of games selection for customers aged 18 to 25.
In this project, we use the WordPress REST API running on the web host to manage the product for the website to be deployed on Netlify.
We use JavaScript to fetch the list of WordPress products to display it on the site instead of having the effect hardcoded into the HTML.
The JavaScript calls the API, and we are using a Headless CMS.
